Goal: create an app that can display a website and show a users mouse movement on it.

Set up a github!

Client Side Javascript Snippet:
1. Download the assets of the website to be viewed externally
    - The HTML of the page
    - The CSS
    - The JS
2. Track mouse movements

Tracking:
1. Define a payload of information that the front-end will send for mouse movement
  -
2. User session info to differ each user

Back-end Service: (NodeJS Express server)
1. NodeJS bot that will fetch external CSS and Images from visited pages
    - Upload assets to S3 bucket
2. Endpoint to recieve event data from client website (mouse movements, dom changes, button clicks) (JSON) -> POST
3. Read the event data (mouse movements to start) -> GET

Front-end Service (Viewing user sessions) -> Angular 9
1. Display the front-end assets from S3 (served up from cloudfront)
2. Query the back-end service for the mouse movements and then display them.
3. Bonus points for timeline and play and pause (ability to move back and forth)
